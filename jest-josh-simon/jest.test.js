// Process: Write the test FIRST. Ensure the test fails correctly. Then write the code that will make the test pass.

// Note: You do not need to comment out the old tests or functions. The purpose of tests are to be AUTOMATED. Commenting them out defeats that purpose.


//     Write the test for a function that returns "drink coffee" if you are tired and "keep working" if you are not tired.
//         Create the function that will make the test pass.

// input: are you tired? yes/no.
//output: "drink coffee", "keep working"

//     Write the test for a function that returns "relax" if you are stressed and "keep going" if you are not stressed.
//         Create the function that will make the test pass.

// input: stressed? yes/no (string)
// output: yes: "relax", no: "keep going" (string)

// pseudocode: create a function stressCheck that will take a user input of "yes" or "no".
//  create an if/else conditional where if the user enters "yes", it will return "relax". else if the user enters "no", it will return "keep going".
